'objects.sfdx' is a modded file which now enables the debris as a projectile when explosion, kicking
or flying to the players and can be damage and knock off players like they were.
(In version Pre-Alpha if I'm not confused)

Well, there is a script in Steam Workshop that have the same effect and its safer as it's just a script,
not a modded game file, but honestly I'm playing this game with a cracked version so I can't download it,
so I just made one for myself, and that's how this mod was created :)
