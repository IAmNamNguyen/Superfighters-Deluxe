----------
You can create your own map category by creating your own folder next to this file and place any .sfdm maps you want to include in that folder.

----------
You can also create your own map category by creating a textfile (.txt) next to this README.txt file containing all the paths to the maps you want to include.

Example:
C:\Users\USER\Documents\Superfighters Deluxe\Maps\Downloaded\Abc.sfdm
C:\Users\USER\Documents\Superfighters Deluxe\Maps\Downloaded\FooBar.sfdm
D:\ProgramFiles\Steam\steamapps\common\Superfighters Deluxe\Content\Data\Maps\Official\vs\Rooftops.sfdm

----------
You can also add relative paths to the maps from the root SFD documents folders '\Users\USER\Documents\Superfighters Deluxe\Maps' and from the SFD installation folder '\Program\Steam\steamapps\common\Superfighters Deluxe\Content\Data\Maps'

Example:
Downloaded\Abc.sfdm
Downloaded\FooBar.sfdm
Official\vs\Rooftops.sfdm

----------
You can also add all maps from an existing folder by typing in the relative folder path where the root will be '\Users\USER\Documents\Superfighters Deluxe\Maps' or from the SFD installation folder '\Program\Steam\steamapps\common\Superfighters Deluxe\Content\Data\Maps'

Example:
Downloaded\
Official\vs\

----------
You can also add subscribed maps from the steam workshop by adding the published file id. This ensures the map is always up-to-date if the author updates the map. The steam workshop folder for SFD will be something like '\Program\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\855860\'. 
To add the '...\workshop\content\855860\1526878290\PONG-ISH.sfdm' map to your category type the publish file id, Example:
1526878290
